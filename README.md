# Duality Bitmap Font Asset Importer
A bitmap font asset importer for the [Duality game engine](http://duality.adamslair.net/)

## How to use
* Generate the image (see Editors below)
* Drag and drop both the png (currently only supports pngs) and the xml bmfont file into Duality
* Create a TextRenderer and allocate the font to it (or just drag the font onto the scene)

* Desktop 
  * Bitmap Font Generator - http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/ - make sure you use 32 bit depth, png file, and xml file type. White on alpha is the best preset. (check http://mika76.github.io/duality-bitmapfont-importer/bmfont_settings.png)
